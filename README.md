# myscript-code
this is the myscript android app and is in ALPHA stages. Here is a list of thing that will be added in NO specific order 
1. better not creation and deletion gui (something similar to how notabilities note choosing GUI looks) 
2. ability to use a pen that does not get converted 
3. ability to pinch and zoom converted items 
4.ability to import pdf and other files 
5. instead of having the whole screen being taken up by my script, the user will be able to create text boxes. This means that you could choose where you want to write in math. This is very useful for worksheets. 
6. IMPORTANT make everything save. preferably this will be done after we finished most of everything else this way we can just kind of save all the variables. this will make the code  look less like some spaghetti and more like something remotely decent 
7.speaking of making the code decent, improve the way the code works, remove some of the debug messages
